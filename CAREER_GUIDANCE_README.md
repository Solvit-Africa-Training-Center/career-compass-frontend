### Algorithm Details

#### Academic Match Calculation
- **GPA Score (40%)**: Compares student GPA to major requirements
- **Subject Match (40%)**: Analyzes required vs. completed subjects
- **Credit Completeness (20%)**: Evaluates academic preparation level

#### Personality Match Calculation
- **Big Five Traits**: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- **Holland Code**: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional
- **Weighted Scoring**: Based on major-specific personality requirements

#### Overall Recommendation Score
```
Overall Match = (Academic Match Ã— 0.6) + (Personality Match Ã— 0.4)
```
